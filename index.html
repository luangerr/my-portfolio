  <h1>👋 Hi, I am Thais Da Silva</h1>
  </center>

  <p>
   I am from Venezuela, but I have been living in the UK for around five years. My first
    language is Spanish, and I am 25 years old. I consider myself an ambitious, clever, and
    well-organized person. I am passionate about learning new things, especially in the
    field of technology. I enjoy challenging myself, improving my skills, and working on
    personal growth every day. Living abroad has helped me become more independent,
    confident, and open-minded.

    <h2>📁 Recent projects</h2>
    <ul>
      <h4>Working on C++ projects like: </h4>
      <li> Winning Division</li>
      <p> This project determines which of a company’s four divisions has the highest sales for the quarter.
        I created two functions: one to safely collect the sales for each division, and another to compare all values and determine the highest.
        This improved my skills in functions, conditionals, and logical decision-making in C++.</p>
      <li> Isosceles Triangle Class </li>
      <p> <I created a class called IsoscelesTriangle that stores the base and height of the triangle. 
            The program calculates both the area and the perimeter using a class with member functions. 
            This project introduced me to object-oriented programming concepts, such as constructors, encapsulation, and class methods./p>
        
      <h4>Creating this portfolio using HTML + CSS</h4>
        <p> Designed a responsive portfolio to present my skills, background, and projects. Hosted using GitHub Pages. 
          Continually updated as I progress in my studies.</p>
        <h4> Event Management ERD (In Progress)</h4>
        <p> A database project where I am designing the relationships between events, organisers, venues, registrations, and feedback. 
          Still in development as I refine the structure and connections.</p>
