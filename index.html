    <!-- About Me section: personal background and introduction -->
    I am from Venezuela, but I have been living in the UK for around five years. My first
    language is Spanish, and I am 25 years old. I consider myself an ambitious, clever, and
    well-organized person. I am passionate about learning new things, especially in the
    field of technology. I enjoy challenging myself, improving my skills, and working on
    personal growth every day. Living abroad has helped me become more independent,
    confident, and open-minded.

      <h4>Working on C++ projects like:</h4>

      <li>Winning Division</li>
      <p>
        <!-- Description of the Winning Division project -->
        This project determines which of a company’s four divisions has the highest sales for the quarter.
        I created two functions: one to safely collect the sales for each division, and another to compare all values and determine the highest.
        This improved my skills in functions, conditionals, and logical decision-making in C++.
      </p>

      <li>Isosceles Triangle Class</li>
      <p>
        <!-- Object-oriented programming project description -->
        I created a class called IsoscelesTriangle that stores the base and height of the triangle. 
        The program calculates both the area and the perimeter using a class with member functions. 
        This project introduced me to object-oriented programming concepts, such as constructors, encapsulation, and class methods.
      </p>

      <h4>Creating this portfolio using HTML + CSS</h4>
      <p>
        <!-- Description of the portfolio project -->
        Designed a responsive portfolio to present my skills, background, and projects. Hosted using GitHub Pages. 
        Continually updated as I progress in my studies.

      <h4>Event Management ERD (In Progress)</h4>
      <p>
        <!-- Database modelling project -->
        A database project where I am designing the relationships between events, organisers, venues, registrations, and feedback. 
        Still in development as I refine the structure and connections.
